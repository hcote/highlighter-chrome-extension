1. background script listens for an event to wake it up (icon click)
2. grab the window object
2. highlight text and store it in storage
3. * text is now highlighted *

4. highlight over some of the highlighted text 
5. * the selected text gets unhighlighted *

click the icon to load the background script
chrome.runtime.getBackgroundPage(function callback) => gets the window object














PROBLEM AT HAND
--- URL and span text are overwriting the previous values every new highlight
--- your highlights are stored but your unhighlights are not unstored
--- GLOBAL VARIABLE?
